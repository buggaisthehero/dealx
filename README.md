Selenium Assessment

This solution is based on the DealX â€“ QA Automation Assessment which instructed me to test the functionality of website (http://automationpractice.com/index.php).
I have used Java, Selenium, Maven and TestNG. To run the tests simply right click the testng.xml file in the project structure and click "Run testng.xml", ensure testng is installed and included asa plugin.

Thank you for the opportunity
